  title: Why Kaldi
  description: >
    Kaldi is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.

  Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from

        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.

##### Masonite Digital Innovation Team

This design process is an iterative method that helps you continuously improve and polish your designs. In the process, you go through different stages repeatedly while evaluating your designs on each stage. Each stage involves relevant stakeholders in your organization that take part in the process to make your products highly efficient and usable.

Note that this process is elastic. You might need to expand or contract each stage based on the needs of your project, but you should still go through each stage. You might also need to go backwards as new insights arise.

Each stage has different activities you should and could do. Your Discovery has sliders that define how much do we want to innovate, how urgent a project is and how much are we willing to invest. Based on that you decide which things you will do.

##### Tools

- **Design tool for making wireframes/High-fidelity designs** (Examples: Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD)
- **Design handover/documentation tool** (Examples: Zeplin, Abstract, Invision, Airtable)
- **Communication tools** (Examples: Slack, Skype, Zoom, Teams)
- **Note taking tool** (Examples: Notion, Confluence, OneNote, Things, Evernote)
- **Code Editor** (Examples: Atom, VS Code, Sublime Text)

##### How does this process work alongside Agile and engineering?

We practice a loose Dual-track agile process, an approach advocated by Marty Cagan of the Silicon Valley Product Group.

In this methodology, there is a discovery track (learn about the problems, e.g. Discover, Concept, Scope) and a delivery track (build the solution, e.g. Detail, Build) - reminisicent of the classic Double Diamond
